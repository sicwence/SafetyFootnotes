Trying to build a simple eForm app that can be completed by users off-line and data stored locally on the Android device 
using SQLite database. The app should than be able to email the completed sheet as the users' email address. I'm struggling
with getting SQLite database set up to store data and also email feature to submit completed sheets. Any help would be greatly
appreciated!
